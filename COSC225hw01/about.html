    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently a student at Amherst College. I have a <em>diverse</em> set of interests 
        and love exploring interdisciplinary subjects. Talk to me about plants, food, or anything philosophical. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope to continue exploring departments outside of my own by taking <em>at least</em> one course in an unfamiliar 
        department each semester. 
    </p>
    <h3>Brief Backstory:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Born in <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>.</li>
        <li>Family moved to <strong>California</strong>.</li>
        <li>Arrived at <strong>Amherst</strong> with no game plan and randomly threw intro cs onto my schedule. 
            I had fun and decided to keep taking courses in the department.
            <ul><li>Declared both Philosophy and Computer Science in the fall of 2022.</li></ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Some random things that make me happy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>plants</li>
        <li>building mechanical keyboards</li>
        <li>our dog, a toy poodle named Chocolate</li>
        <li><strong>aged</strong> cheese (and <strong>gouda</strong>)</li>
        <li>knitting</li>
        <li> the color grey. There are an endless number of pleasant warm and cool greys. For example:
            <ul>
                <li><em>this</em> <span id=blueGrey>blue grey</span> or</li>
                <li><em>this</em> <span id=purpleGrey>purple grey</span> or</li>
                <li><em>this</em> <span id=greenGrey>green grey</span></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>translated literature</li>
        <li>journaling, fountain pens, and ink
            <ul>
                <li>I love visiting local stationary stores wherever I travel. Who knew paper could be 
                    such a personal and complicated subject!</li>
                <li>Nothing beats the <em>tactile</em> sensation of writing on paper...this might be the 
                explanation for my interest in mechanical keyboards.</li>
                    
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>creating art (I grew up studying fine arts outside of school and actually applied to Amherst with an art 
            portfolio)</li>
        <li>petrichor</li>
    </ul>
